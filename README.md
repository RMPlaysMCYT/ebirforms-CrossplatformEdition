# eBIRForms Cross Platform Edition
Make Philippines eBIRFORMS available on Windows, Mac and Linux

This project was web-app based where it serves it's purpose but it's expanded to MacOS and Linux also as the original and official version was made exclusively for Windows

Overview:
The Electronic Bureau of Internal Revenue Forms (eBIRForms) was developed primarily to provide taxpayers with an alternative mode of preparing and filing tax returns that is easier and more convenient. The use of eBIRForms by taxpayers will improve the BIR's tax return data capture and storage thereby enhancing efficiency and accuracy in the filing of tax returns. Through the use of the downloadable eBIRForms Software Package (also known as the Offline Package), taxpayers and Accredited Tax Agents (ATAs) will be able to fill up tax returns offline and submit it to the BIR through the Online eBIRForms System.
